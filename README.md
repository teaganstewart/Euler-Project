<h2> #Euler-Project - Learning to Optimize Code! </h2> <br> 
This is part of the 100 Day Euler Project as part of the freeCodeCamp. I will be using this to learn new langauges like C#, and to strengthen ones I know like JavaScript, C and C++. Another goal of the project is to learn to optimise code and know the ideal data structures for certain situations. <br> <br>

All programs require either Node.js or .NET to be installed, depending on whether the code is in JavaScript or C#. C/C++ programs can be compiled using a gcc/g++ compiler on the commandline. <br> <br>

<b> All in the Command Line </b> <br> 
For all first navigate to the location of the program file (C#) or source code (C/C++/JavaScript). While at the location run: <br>

JavaScript: $ node file-name.js <br>
C#: $ dotnet run <br>
C: $ gcc filename.c <br>
   $ filename <br>
C++: $ g++ filename.cpp <br>
     $ ./a.out <br>
     
The program should now be running. There is a seperate README file in each directory that specifies what the script/ program should do when running correctly.
